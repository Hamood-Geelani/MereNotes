# MereNotes
This is MereNotes, a web app I made myself!


Ok, so this is how to use the app. First we connect our app to MongoDB( a non relational database querly language). I have used ATLAS ( a free cloud storage service) for hosting the connection. I then used FastAPI to connect my backend with my front end. I used UVICORN.
To start the application, use your unique MongoDB key and username for connection. 
Then, write : uvicorn index:app --reload    in the terminal to start the application!
